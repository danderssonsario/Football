## Description
The game is a two player/team football game. Objective is to run into the ball with your player to "kick" it to end up in your opponents goal. A score is then given to your player and the ball respawns in the middle of the field.

### Development
- The game is rendered to a HTML-canvas element.
- Vite's provided dev server is used to run the application.
- ESLint is used for consistent formatting. 
- The code is written in a MVC-pattern to embrace separations of concerns and low coupling/high cohesion.
